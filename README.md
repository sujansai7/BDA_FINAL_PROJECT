# Communication Plan
We plan to communicate via Whatsapp, email and slack and conduct weekly meetings on Saturday on Google meet.

# Meeting Notes

We communicated about the dataset by going over many datasets in the AWS registry, kaggle, finalized the dataset and also discussed the business problem this dataset solves, further discussed the Machine learning models we can implement using this dataset.


# Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge

The dataset we have choosen is from kaggle where it has been collected from a popular website in russia with ads for the sale of cars, the dataset is frequently updated on a weekly basis it contains information related to cars in over 18 columns among which it has coloumns like price of the car, brand name, fuel type, color, mileage,power etc. We can use this data to derive some useful information like what price range people are most interested to buy in, what kind of color people like the most irrespective of the price, what kind of fuel typed cars are given most importance, and also understand the correlation between different variables that are tightly related using correlation graph so it gives us which variables in the dataset are closely related so that they can be given more importance.


#  Selection of relevant data

The dataset has been choosen from kaggle website, and it has been collected from a popular webiste in russia, the link to the dataset can be found here.

# Research Objectives and Question(s)

Some of the questions we intend to solve with this dataset are which fueltype vechicles are having higher priority, what is the price range that most of the customers are willing to buy, what body type vehicles are much prefered, what kind of transmission are the customers purchasing most etc.
Using the data set we plan to pre-process the data and use it, to meet our specific goals by analyzing and finding any patterns in the given dataset.
Use the Machine learning model on this dataset to do a predictive analysis task. we plan on choosing regression models like simple linear regression and polynomial linear regression on the given dataset and visualising using different kinds of graphs to understand the trends in a better way.
